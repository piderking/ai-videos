If she gets her GPA back above the threshold next semester, we can apparently 'readdress' the situation to determine if her scholarship can be reinstated for the final semester of school. When I tell you we bent over backwards trying to find a solution before we came to the one we did... we've done the math, and she can't get her grades up with how much of the semester is left. She also can't take enough credits during the summer based on how the summer classes are structured to raise her GPA high enough even if she got As, and the school refuses to make any exceptions.  \nOf course, we were upset with her for allowing this to happen, and we had a long talk with her, and she's upset at herself too.

She became extremely upset, and told us that it was unfair we were 'rewarding' our oldest for failing and 'punishing' her for succeeding, and \"who's car we would sell if the same happened to her?\" But, we never wanted her to feel punished, or for our oldest to feel rewarded.

I could've easily just gone to live with my older brother, Nile (M23), instead of being forced to live with some strangers.\n\nThe couple I live with, Mavis and Daniel (F49,M50) are okay I suppose. They're more keen on me than I am on them. They couldn't have kids of their own and they're doing their best to make me theirs, which can be stifling. They don't understand that I'm not a toddler or some super sheltered teenager that they need to be protective over. \n\nThey freak about almost anything, Mavis gets upset if I wear make up, she freaked out when I got my ears pierced with some of my friends last year. She keeps saying that she doesn't want to jeopardise anything that would forbid them from adopting me in the long term.\n\nMy foster parents dislike Nile, they don't like the way he speaks (very heavy manchester accent, swears a lot), he's come over once on my birthday and they told him off for calling me 'our kid'. They think that he's rough, just because he doesn't live conventionally and is quite bohemian.\n\nI don't see him a lot as he's an audio technician for gigs and he tends to travel a lot. He's been in town recently and he's called me to ask if I'd like to go and spend time with him, he'd even pay for the eyebrow piercing I've been wanting. Of course, I agreed.\n\nHe turned up at the house, all set to pick me up, I even told Daniel prior and he said that it was alright. Literally as I was putting my coat on, Mavis came and started acting as if something horrible was going to happen. She said that Nile can't take me out because it wasn't previously arranged with the social worker, and that she ' doesn't trust him enough to take care of a vulnerable teenager right.'

We said before that we didn't like each other, but now we were cuddling and it was unfair because we lied to her. I told her we didn't lie, but she couldn't hold us to something we said years ago.

She is really into LEGO and has started a YouTube channel with our permission to share some videos of her builds. It\u2019s just a small, amateur channel with a few hundred followers but she\u2019s very passionate about it.\n\nBecause of this hobby she made some friends online, and those in the group that live close by decided to meet for the first time. The meet was in a city an hour away and I was the one to drive her there. They are also young teens ranging from 11 to 14 (I think the oldest was 15), and most of them have their own LEGO-based channels. It was a lovely meet, just young people bonding over a shared interest.\n\nBut one thing that surprised me was that my stepdaughter was the only girl in the group. All of them are teenage boys. They also didn\u2019t know she was a girl because her YouTube channel doesn\u2019t have her name or any personal information, and her videos are mostly of their builds and she doesn\u2019t show her face (at mine and her father\u2019s insistence). So there was this cute moment of shock in their faces when they were trying to figure out who she could be. They quickly got over it.\n\nThe thing is my husband didn\u2019t take it so well when I told him about this after we came home. He thinks it\u2019s an \u201call-boys\u201d group and it\u2019s not appropriate for his daughter to be in future meets (because they are already planning the next one to build a project together). I thought his concern was so ludicrous that my immediate reaction was to laugh. I guess there was a part of me that thought it was amusing to see his \u201cprotective father\u201d instincts kick in.\n\nHe got really upset with me for laughing, saying I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s like for hormonal boys being this age. I doubled down by telling him he was just being silly - I was there the entire time, and so did other parents, and the same would happen in any future events.

She is really into LEGO and has started a YouTube channel with our permission to share some videos of her builds. It\u2019s just a small, amateur channel with a few hundred followers but she\u2019s very passionate about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this hobby she made some friends online, and those in the group that live close by decided to meet for the first time. The meet was in a city an hour away and I was the one to drive her there. They are also young teens ranging from 11 to 14 (I think the oldest was 15), and most of them have their own LEGO-based channels. It was a lovely meet, just young people bonding over a shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But one thing that surprised me was that my stepdaughter was the only girl in the group. All of them are teenage boys. They also didn\u2019t know she was a girl because her YouTube channel doesn\u2019t have her name or any personal information, and her videos are mostly of their builds and she doesn\u2019t show her face (at mine and her father\u2019s insistence). So there was this cute moment of shock in their faces when they were trying to figure out who she could be. They quickly got over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing is my husband didn\u2019t take it so well when I told him about this after we came home. He thinks it\u2019s an \u201call-boys\u201d group and it\u2019s not appropriate for his daughter to be in future meets (because they are already planning the next one to build a project together). I thought his concern was so ludicrous that my immediate reaction was to laugh. I guess there was a part of me that thought it was amusing to see his \u201cprotective father\u201d instincts kick in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He got really upset with me for laughing, saying I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s like for hormonal boys being this age. I doubled down by telling him he was just being silly - I was there the entire time, and so did other parents, and the same would happen in any future events. There was nothing inappropriate about this. It took me a while to realize he was SO serious about this subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, he realized eventually it would be grossly unfair to deprive his daughter of these new friendships, but he&amp;#39;s still mad at me for laughing and calling him silly.

Before marrying my husband I told him I did not want children. I don\u2019t hate children or anything, they just stress me out. I am on the spectrum and get easily overwhelmed. My family and friends know how I feel about children. They all know I\u2019m a people pleaser as well. I sometimes agree to babysit my child cousins or my husband\u2019s college friend\u2019s kids to be nice. I am never compensated which is fine except twice when I was given $20. (It\u2019s been three years) My cousins aren\u2019t that bad but they aren\u2019t dumped on me unlike my husband\u2019s friend\u2019s children. And these kids are AWFUL. Their parents let them get away with everything and then I am having to deal with the unruly behavior. I am losing my mind and because I am stressed this causes arguments between me and my husband. He makes excuses for his friend not asking me to watch his kids. He just drops them off and I\u2019ve even asked the friend to inform me first.
