We don't have any kids together, yet, but she does have 2 kids from a previous relationship (16F &amp; 12M).  I get along great with her kids, especially her son.  Her daughter, Jane, is definitely in the middle of the angsty, moody teenager stage where she wants nothing to do with her parents.  But we've never had any major issues.\n\nHowever, Jane does suffer from Micrognathia.  It severely impacts her self-esteem and confidence.  She's been bullied quite a bit and it breaks my heart to see her upset.  My fiance has dental insurance through her job, but it wouldn't cover the entire corrective surgery, not even half.  They've done consultations and gotten the go-ahead to proceed with the surgery, but the cost is incredibly high.  Even after insurance, when everything is said and done the bill will likely be over $25K.  My fiance has looked into financing for it, but money is tight these days and we've both been saving for the wedding and honeymoon.\n\nA couple weeks ago, Jane came home from school in tears again after being teased.  My fiance and I calmed her down and during the conversation Jane expressed how much she wants the surgery because, in her eyes, everything in her life would be so much easier if she did.\n\nThat night, my fiance and I were talking about Jane and she asked me if I would be willing to help pay for Jane's surgery.  I have a good job and make a decent living, but I don't have that kind of money saved.  I asked her how much she has saved to put towards it and she said about $5K.\n\nI told her that I feel terrible for Jane and what she's going through, but I don't have that kind of money.  And the money I do have saved is earmarked for the wedding and honeymoon.  My fiance said she would be fine with a courthouse wedding and no honeymoon if it means that Jane can get the surgery.\n\nI reminded her that I want a real wedding, not a huge one, but a real one.  And that we've already been brainstorming honeymoon ideas.  She got upset at this point and told me I was being selfish for putting my own wants over Jane's needs.  She told me that if Jane was my own daughter then she bets I would pay for it in a heartbeat.  That comment pissed me off because it was a low blow and I told her that was a BS thing to say.  We kept fighting for a bit after that without resolving anything and I ended up leaving to calm down.\n\nThe next time we talked she did apologize for what she said.  But she also said that she still believes that's true.  She said if I'm going to be a step-dad that I need to treat the kids as if they were my own, which means sacrificing things I want for them.\n\nI told her that while I love Jane, I can't help but feel like I'm being treated like an ATM here.  My fiance said this is the first time she's ever asked me for financial help and that this will be life-changing for Jane.\n\nEDIT:  Well, the wedding is off and I took the ring back.  We fought about this again last night and she gave me an ultimatum.  Either I pay for Jane's surgery, or we break up.  Not just help pay for it, the whole thing.  I told her I felt like she was using me to pay for Jane's surgery.  She told me she wanted to be with me because she thought I would be a good provider for her kids and if I wasn't wiling to fork out $25K to improve Jane's life, then they were better off without me.

To a point where I guess my sister even asked to have the 3yo sleep with my daughter so she could get up with her in the morning so she could sleep in. My daughter stated that the only time my sister came downstairs was to shower or make food for herself. The rest of the time, my kids were left to fend for themselves and take care of the 3yo - including meals. My sister's BF lives there full time and doesn't work either, so he never leaves.

I was born in Bangladesh and moved to America with my family when I was in primary school. I've been with my wife for awhile, and I get along with her family relatively well, except for her brother. Overall, I'd say her little brother is extremely spoiled and entitled. He's 20 years old and I swear he just has no ability to understand other people. My wife is White.\n\nIt's Ramadan, and my parents invited my wife and her family over for Iftar, which is when we break our fast, and then dinner afterwards. This is done strictly at sundown, which was around 7:30. Although I'm not very religious, I do fast, and my wife usually fasts with me. I told her family the details of everything, including that food would be served exactly at sundown, and that there would be two meals, one at sundown, and then another one about an hour later, which is the proper dinner.\n\nLeading up to it, my BIL texted in the family group chat (which includes me) and asked me \"not to make Indian food\". I responded with, \"That shouldn't be a problem, I won't be cooking Indian food.\" The way I see it, this was a true statement in every way. Indian food would not be served, and I would not be making it, since my mom would be the one cooking Bengali food. And I also just thought it was weird to go to someone's house for dinner and demand they not cook their traditional food, but that's besides the point.\n\nOn the day of, everyone comes by around 6. We have iftar a little after 7:30, as planned, although BIL didn't really make that smooth either, since he was complaining about how hungry he was and why we were eating so late. He seemed fine with the iftar foods, which were some fried foods and haleem, which is almost like a meat and lentil stew. Then for dinner, we had biryani and a few different types of curry, and that's where the issues started. He again complained that he doesn't like \"Indian food\" and asked if he could have more of the stuff from earlier. Problem is, that was all finished, so he asked my mom if she could just make more. I wasn't going to let her do that after fasting and cooking all day, so I said no. He got annoyed and basically sulked for the rest of the night, and then later texted in the group chat that I lied. His parents agreed that I didn't lie, but that I \"knew what he meant\" and should've asked my parents to be \"more accommodating to their guests\". I fired back that they've never even bothered to get halal meat when inviting my parents over, and last time all they could eat was bread and mashed potatoes.\n\nThis happened over a week ago.

I was born in Bangladesh and moved to America with my family when I was in primary school. I&amp;#39;ve been with my wife for awhile, and I get along with her family relatively well, except for her brother. Overall, I&amp;#39;d say her little brother is extremely spoiled and entitled. He&amp;#39;s 20 years old and I swear he just has no ability to understand other people. My wife is White.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s Ramadan, and my parents invited my wife and her family over for Iftar, which is when we break our fast, and then dinner afterwards. This is done strictly at sundown, which was around 7:30. Although I&amp;#39;m not very religious, I do fast, and my wife usually fasts with me. I told her family the details of everything, including that food would be served exactly at sundown, and that there would be two meals, one at sundown, and then another one about an hour later, which is the proper dinner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leading up to it, my BIL texted in the family group chat (which includes me) and asked me &amp;quot;not to make Indian food&amp;quot;. I responded with, &amp;quot;That shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem, I won&amp;#39;t be cooking Indian food.&amp;quot; The way I see it, this was a true statement in every way. Indian food would not be served, and I would not be making it, since my mom would be the one cooking Bengali food. And I also just thought it was weird to go to someone&amp;#39;s house for dinner and demand they not cook their traditional food, but that&amp;#39;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the day of, everyone comes by around 6. We have iftar a little after 7:30, as planned, although BIL didn&amp;#39;t really make that smooth either, since he was complaining about how hungry he was and why we were eating so late. He seemed fine with the iftar foods, which were some fried foods and haleem, which is almost like a meat and lentil stew. Then for dinner, we had biryani and a few different types of curry, and that&amp;#39;s where the issues started. He again complained that he doesn&amp;#39;t like &amp;quot;Indian food&amp;quot; and asked if he could have more of the stuff from earlier. Problem is, that was all finished, so he asked my mom if she could just make more. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to let her do that after fasting and cooking all day, so I said no. He got annoyed and basically sulked for the rest of the night, and then later texted in the group chat that I lied. His parents agreed that I didn&amp;#39;t lie, but that I &amp;quot;knew what he meant&amp;quot; and should&amp;#39;ve asked my parents to be &amp;quot;more accommodating to their guests&amp;quot;. I fired back that they&amp;#39;ve never even bothered to get halal meat when inviting my parents over, and last time all they could eat was bread and mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This happened over a week ago. My parents invited them over for Eid, which is tomorrow, and he said no, and then blamed me for &amp;quot;tricking&amp;quot; him last time.

While i was missing from school, I got a message from a classmate, lets name her Sarah. On that day when I was missing, she got into an argument with her friend group, and she messaged me asking me if we could share a room into this school trip. Because I didnt know how bad of a person she is, I said yes.\n\nSarah found a room with 2 weird and shy girls, lets name them Jasmine and Mandy. I was staying in a separate room by myself. We played games together, and I saw Sarah record me while i was just making a meow sound, that she made me do it for fun. She also recorded Jasmine and Mandy, and she also sent me the vids of them doing funny things. \n\nEverything is going fine, fast forward and we were playing truth or dare. Sarah dared me to go to a random room in the hotel and ask for toilet paper. I went into a completely random room with no one in and a girl, lets name her Laura, opened the door. I asked her for toilet paper and then told her it was a dare. And Laura asked me who i was playing with. I told her the girls names. And then i went back into Sarah, Mandy and Jasmines room to see that they locked me out. I waited a while till they opened the door for me. And i suddently Sarah all angry. She got mad at me because I talked to Laura and told her that I was playing with her. (and that doesnt make any sense whatsoever). Also moments before we were playing this game she started picking on my looks but i didnt tought much of it. Her behaviour was leaving me very confused. \n\nI end up being fed up with it and leave the room, because Sarah started demanding me the fact that i should go to a door again and do that dare again otherwise she \"promises\" that she wont lock me out again. I got fed up and said that I am going to grab my things and leave the room. \n\nI overshared to them about how my mum drank and smoked while pregnant and just made a silly joke about how i had a crush on this creepy old man that is our history teacher, and i was also talking very fast because that is my way of talking. They ended up using these against me to bully me. To sum it all up they all spam call me, threaten me with repeating the school year and bomb my phone with texts for no reason.

While i was missing from school, I got a message from a classmate, lets name her Sarah. On that day when I was missing, she got into an argument with her friend group, and she messaged me asking me if we could share a room into this school trip. Because I didnt know how bad of a person she is, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah found a room with 2 weird and shy girls, lets name them Jasmine and Mandy. I was staying in a separate room by myself. We played games together, and I saw Sarah record me while i was just making a meow sound, that she made me do it for fun. She also recorded Jasmine and Mandy, and she also sent me the vids of them doing funny things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is going fine, fast forward and we were playing truth or dare. Sarah dared me to go to a random room in the hotel and ask for toilet paper. I went into a completely random room with no one in and a girl, lets name her Laura, opened the door. I asked her for toilet paper and then told her it was a dare. And Laura asked me who i was playing with. I told her the girls names. And then i went back into Sarah, Mandy and Jasmines room to see that they locked me out. I waited a while till they opened the door for me. And i suddently Sarah all angry. She got mad at me because I talked to Laura and told her that I was playing with her. (and that doesnt make any sense whatsoever). Also moments before we were playing this game she started picking on my looks but i didnt tought much of it. Her behaviour was leaving me very confused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I end up being fed up with it and leave the room, because Sarah started demanding me the fact that i should go to a door again and do that dare again otherwise she &amp;quot;promises&amp;quot; that she wont lock me out again. I got fed up and said that I am going to grab my things and leave the room. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I overshared to them about how my mum drank and smoked while pregnant and just made a silly joke about how i had a crush on this creepy old man that is our history teacher, and i was also talking very fast because that is my way of talking. They ended up using these against me to bully me. To sum it all up they all spam call me, threaten me with repeating the school year and bomb my phone with texts for no reason. Once i replied to their phone call and they all started making meow noises to mock me. Then they went to some classmates and played the recording of me making the meow sound so they all make fun of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The field trip ends and everyday at school i hear Sarah and the three girls making fun of me.

We had a really short ceremony at the beginning and then partied!\nI specifically asked him to please stay with me and to hang out with me as we mingled around because I know how he gets around his friends and usually I hang by myself if they are around.  And he\u2019s like \u201cyeah of course we will go around together\u201d.  That didn\u2019t happen.  He took off and was gone and I legit spent the majority of party standing by myself. ( 98% of the people there were his) Then at the end of the night it was over around 9 so fairly early,  there was a plan at some point,  a lot of the attendees,  were going to go out to a bar to which he decided he was going.  I wanted to go home, with him, and have our \u201cwedding night\u201d .  This was absolutely not acceptable to him because \u201chis family was in town and going to go out too\u201d\nSo, I stayed home by myself and went to bed while he went out to the bar. \nNext day, I\u2019m upset of course and he keeps asking me why, what did he do? Like how did he not know?  When I explained, it got pushed back on me that I should have kept up with him and he found me 1 time outside when I was trying to cool down cause I was super hot.  So he keeps bringing that one time I \u201cleft\u201d and he found me outside. Then told me that I was making stuff up and I wasn\u2019t alone and that if I was it was my fault. \nSo, is it my fault? AITA? \n\nAdding\u2026 for people who have to know where my people are\u2026 as if it matters one way or another. My Dad is dead, my mother has Alzheimer\u2019s and was unable to attend.  Yes my sister was there and my adult nieces and a friend. That\u2019s what I had. And honestly who was there isn\u2019t the issue just added  in the original post to give context that it was mostly his friends.  I am an introvert and have social anxiety, but can handle and deal when needed.  \nAnd no, I wasn\u2019t sitting in a corner all night \u201cpoor me\u201d I was out and about. Just by myself.

We had a really short ceremony at the beginning and then partied!\nI specifically asked him to please stay with me and to hang out with me as we mingled around because I know how he gets around his friends and usually I hang by myself if they are around.  And he\u2019s like \u201cyeah of course we will go around together\u201d.  That didn\u2019t happen.  He took off and was gone and I legit spent the majority of party standing by myself. ( 98% of the people there were his) Then at the end of the night it was over around 9 so fairly early,  there was a plan at some point,  a lot of the attendees,  were going to go out to a bar to which he decided he was going.  I wanted to go home, with him, and have our \u201cwedding night\u201d .  This was absolutely not acceptable to him because \u201chis family was in town and going to go out too\u201d\nSo, I stayed home by myself and went to bed while he went out to the bar. \nNext day, I\u2019m upset of course and he keeps asking me why, what did he do? Like how did he not know?  When I explained, it got pushed back on me that I should have kept up with him and he found me 1 time outside when I was trying to cool down cause I was super hot.  So he keeps bringing that one time I \u201cleft\u201d and he found me outside. Then told me that I was making stuff up and I wasn\u2019t alone and that if I was it was my fault. \nSo, is it my fault? AITA? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adding\u2026 for people who have to know where my people are\u2026 as if it matters one way or another.

And honestly who was there isn\u2019t the issue just added  in the original post to give context that it was mostly his friends.

I asked what's wrong and he said he couldn't believe Cass could be so stupid and foolish as to drink and ignore the baby's needs like that. He's very particular over Cass as she lived with us for part of her childhood and he expects more from her than any of our other nieces or nephews. I asked him how on earth is she doing anything wrong? He responded with she's got a baby that's only 3 months old and her and Mike are getting hammered and not even taking care of the responsibility they created. I told him in case he didn't hear, Cass and Mike hired a babysitter to spend the night and help out with the baby so they could have a fun night in. My husband feels that's just unacceptable and will lead to them making more poor decisions, just like that. I rolled my eyes and laughed and told him he's being ridiculous, Cass and Mike are wonderful young adults, they love their baby, and made sure all was taken care of.
